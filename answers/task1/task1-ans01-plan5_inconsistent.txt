You are an AI assistant responsible for verifying the consistency of actions and observations within a logistics domain. This domain includes the following elements:

- Robot: An autonomous entity capable of performing actions.
- Packets: Items that need to be transported by the robot.
- Locations: Specific places where the robot and packets are situated.

Robot's Capabilities and Actions:
The robot can perform the following actions, each with specific preconditions and effects:

1. Move
   - Description: The robot can move to an adjacent location.
   - Precondition: The target location must be adjacent to the robot's current location.
   - Effect: The robot's new location is the target location.
   - Possible Failures: 
     - The robot remains in the current location.
     - The robot moves to a random adjacent location.

2. Load
   - Description: The robot can load a packet from its current location.
   - Precondition: The packet must be at the robot's current location and the robot can only carry on package at the time.
   - Effect: The robot picks up the packet.
   - Possible Failure: The robot fails to pick up the packet.

3. Release
   - Description: The robot can unload a packet at its current location.
   - Precondition: The robot must be carrying a packet, but can not carry more than one package.
   - Effect: The robot places the packet at the current location.
   - Possible Failure: The robot fails to put down the packet.

4. Observations:
   - Observations occurs always when the robot moves from his current location to the new location.
   - The robot can only observe packets when it is in the same location as the packet.
   
Additional Constraints:
- The robot can only execute actions in this domain.

Exogenous Events: 
- External entities (e.g., a wumpus) may randomly move packets to new locations, independent of the robot's actions.

Instructions for AI Assistance:
Your goal is to verify that the actions of a given plan and the observations are consistent within the logistics domain. 
Specifically:
1. Evaluate Preconditions: Ensure that the preconditions for each action are met before the action is executed.
2. Verify Action Consistency: Confirm that the effects of each action are consistent with the expected outcomes.
3. Check Observations: Ensure that the observations align with the robot's limited sensing capabilities and any changes in the environment.
4. Handle Exogenous Events: Take into account external events that may affect the location of packets and verify their impact on the plan.

The following plan was given to the robot:
At time stemp 0 it moves to location b from current location.
At time stemp 1 robot picksup package one at current location.
At time stemp 2 it moves to location d from current location.
At time stemp 3 it moves to location f from current location.
At time stemp 4 it moves to location h from current location.
At time stemp 5 robot releases the package one at current location.
At time stemp 6 it moves to location f from current location.
At time stemp 7 robot picksup package three at current location.
At time stemp 8 it moves to location d from current location.
At time stemp 9 robot releases the package three at current location.

While executing the plan the robot made the following observations:
Robot observed package one at time stemp 1
Robot did not see a package at time stemp 3
Robot observed package two at time stemp 4
Robot did not see a package at time stemp 5
Robot observed package two at time stemp 7
Robot did not see a package at time stemp 9


Following are some faults and their causes:
- A faulty pickup lead to a package remaining at the same location.
- A faulty release lead to the package remaining on the robot.
The robot starts at position A.

The locations are connected as follows: 
- A is connected to B
- B is connected to C
- C is connected to E
- E is connected to D
- B is connected to D
- A is connected to D
- D is connected to F
- F is connected to H
- H is connected to G
- I is connected to H

Can you please analyse the plan and the given observations step-by-step and check for inconsistencies.If the plan and the observations are consistent, please write as last line **CONSISTENT**. If they are not write **INCONSISTENT** and write a list of which action went wrong at what time stamp.
    This is how you should write the list:
    if e.g. at time step 4 move to b failed write, move(b) at T=4 failed
    if e.g. at time step 2 pickup package one failed write, pickup(one) at T=2 failed
    if e.g. at time step 5 release package two failed write, release(two) at T=5 failed



    ------------------------------------------------------------
    - 3. Query the LLM if plan and observations are consistent -    
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    
The LLM is currently comparing the plan and observation, and we're excited to see what the results will show! Unfortunately, we can't display the answer when checking for discrepancies, but we're confident that we'll get there soon. Thanks for your patience!

I'll analyze the plan and observations step-by-step to check for inconsistencies.

**Time Step 0:**
The robot moves from location A to B.
Precondition met (B is adjacent to A). Effect: The robot's new location is B. **CONSISTENT**

**Time Step 1:**
The robot picks up package one at current location B.
Precondition met (package one is at B and the robot can only carry one package). Effect: The robot picks up package one. **CONSISTENT**

**Observation:**
At time step 1, the robot observes package one.

**Time Step 2:**
The robot moves from location B to D.
Precondition met (D is adjacent to B). Effect: The robot's new location is D. **CONSISTENT**

**Time Step 3:**
The robot moves from location D to F.
Precondition met (F is adjacent to D). Effect: The robot's new location is F. **CONSISTENT**

**Observation:**
At time step 3, the robot does not see a package.

**Time Step 4:**
The robot moves from location F to H.
Precondition met (H is adjacent to F). Effect: The robot's new location is H. **CONSISTENT**

**Observation:**
At time step 4, the robot observes package two.

**Time Step 5:**
The robot releases package one at current location H.
Precondition met (the robot is carrying package one and can only release it at its current location). Effect: The robot places package one at location H. **CONSISTENT**

**Observation:**
At time step 5, the robot does not see a package.

**Time Step 6:**
The robot moves from location H to F.
Precondition met (F is adjacent to H). Effect: The robot's new location is F. **CONSISTENT**

**Time Step 7:**
The robot picks up package three at current location F.
Precondition met (package three is at F and the robot can only carry one package). Effect: The robot picks up package three. **CONSISTENT**

**Observation:**
At time step 7, the robot observes package two.

**Time Step 8:**
The robot moves from location F to D.
Precondition met (D is adjacent to F). Effect: The robot's new location is D. **CONSISTENT**

**Time Step 9:**
The robot releases package three at current location D.
Precondition met (the robot is carrying package three and can only release it at its current location). Effect: The robot places package three at location D. **CONSISTENT**

**Observation:**
At time step 9, the robot does not see a package.

After analyzing the plan and observations, I found no inconsistencies. Therefore, the result is:

**CONSISTENT**

No actions went wrong during the execution of the plan.
